Hello Pablo and other interviewers from #8 :)

My name is Marcio Costa Barbosa, and here it is my full assessment project.

First of all, I appreciate you guys for being patient;
Second, I didn't put the database config inside a .env because my intension here
is to show the whole code from scratch. So the idea is not having a hidden folder or
file which is used for something inside the project.

Some informations:
- Developed in Node.js
- My chosen database was 'postgres', using docker as a container;
- My chosen ORM was TypeORM, so you can assume that I used TypeScript in the whole project;
- The HTML part of the code is simply the Jest coverage 
- I tried to follow at max the SOLID principles and tried to not break any contracts;
- The assessment doesn't ask for, but I implemented Jest tests (TDD) in 100% of the project methods;
- I had created a new field inside "Employees" so I could verify if that employee is already registered;
I chose to create a "identification document", but then decided to turn back so I could follow the
proposed database fields;
- The table "shops" and "employees_types are related to "employees" working all good so as their entities;
- I couldn't think straight a way for "checkIfShopExists" and "checkIfEmployeeTypeExists" before creating
a new employee without breaking the SOLID principle, but as soon as I figure it out, I will change and commit
the project again (maybe I was tired haha);
- Last but not least, sorry for taking so long to send, I needed to go out for a few hours. :/

And please don't hesitate on asking me if I can give any additional info

Many thanks again for all the patience and I hope we can move forward and maybe have a fit in your team
